        "1. A Decision Tree is a supervised learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It works by splitting the dataset into smaller subsets based on feature values, creating a tree-like structure of decisions. Each internal node represents a test on a feature, branches represent the possible outcomes, and leaf nodes contain the final predictions or class labels.\n",
